preview: "A poetic journey through code's fluid nature, exploring how branches merge and streams embrace distant horizons"
notes:
  composition: "Crafted to capture the organic flow of version control using the tanka's 5-7-5-7-7 syllable structure, blending method call syntax with metaphorical language."
  technical: "Explores git branching and merging through method-like metaphorical expressions, suggesting code as a dynamic, flowing system."
  philosophical: "Reflects on software development as a collaborative journey, where individual changes ripple into greater collective flows."
