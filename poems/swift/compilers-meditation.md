preview: "A contemplative koan exploring type inference as a journey of discovery, questioning whether types are created or merely uncovered through optional binding and type reflection"
notes:
  composition: "This koan uses a three-part structure: exploration of nothingness (through the optional type), contemplation of self-knowledge (through type reflection), and the resolution in pattern matching. Each section builds upon the last while maintaining Swift's natural syntax."
  technical: |
    The poem leverages several Swift language features:

    • Protocol 'Essence' represents potential without implementation
    • Optional type (Any?) embodies the duality of presence and absence
    • Type reflection via type(of:) for introspection
    • Pattern matching with switch to explore optional states
    • Empty cases show the completeness of understanding
  philosophical: |
    The poem explores three interconnected themes:

    1. The nature of nothingness: How can we type something that isn't there?
    2. Self-knowledge: How does a type know itself?
    3. The paradox of options: Is .none a type of presence?
    
    These questions mirror deeper philosophical inquiries about existence, knowledge, and the nature of possibility. The optional type becomes a metaphor for potential existence, while pattern matching represents the ways we try to categorize and understand reality.

// The Compiler asks:
protocol Essence {}

func whatTypeAmI() {
    // Before unwrapping, what lies within?
    let nothing: Any? = nil
    
    // In the space between Some and None
    let self = type(of: nothing)
    
    // The optional always knew its contents
    switch nothing {
    case .some: break
    case .none: break
    }
}
