preview: "A Befunge ghazal that weaves together natural and computational cycles of impermanence, using the language's unique directional flow to create visual pathways that mirror the ebb and flow of memory and time"
notes:
  composition: "Following the ghazal form, each couplet ends with 'fade', creating a consistent rhythm that echoes the cycle of memory management. Befunge's directional operators (v < >) create visual paths that mirror the flow of time and memory. The physical layout of the code embodies the poem's themes of structure and release."
  technical: |
    The Befunge program uses direction-changing instructions to create a flowing pattern through memory space. Each couplet:
    
    - Uses 'v' and '<' to create contained cycles
    - Employs ASCII values for text output
    - Creates pauses with multiplication (*)
    - Maintains consistent spacing for visual harmony
    
    The final '@' operator gracefully terminates the program, like memory returning to the system.
  philosophical: "The poem explores how memory management in computing reflects deeper patterns of impermanence in nature. Like falling leaves or flowing water, memory exists in cycles of allocation and release. The repeated 'fade' endings remind us that all states are temporary, whether in computer memory or in nature. The directional flow of the code itself becomes a meditation on how all paths eventually lead to release."
