preview: "A sequence of five programming koans exploring the mysteries of type checking: self-reference, null states, type conversion, generic bounds, and recursive comprehension"
notes:
  composition: "Each koan is structured as a programming paradox that reveals deeper truths about type systems. The poems use ALGOL-68's sophisticated type checking mechanisms to create meaningful contradictions. Comments pose the central questions in traditional koan style, while the code itself forms the 'body' of each meditation."
  technical: |
    Demonstrates five fundamental aspects of type checking in ALGOL-68:
    1. Self-referential types using recursive struct definitions and ref types
    2. Null value semantics and void type handling
    3. Type conversion through equivalent but distinct type definitions
    4. Generic types with multi-level array references
    5. Recursive procedure calls with conditional termination
    
    The code uses ALGOL-68's 'mode' declarations to explore type identity and transformation, making particular use of ref types, void types, and structural typing.
  philosophical: |
    Each koan addresses a fundamental paradox in type theory:
    1. Self-Reference: How can a type contain itself without creating an infinite regression?
    2. Nullity: Is null a type, a value, or the absence of both?
    3. State Transformation: When a type transforms, what invariants persist?
    4. Generic Bounds: How can a type be both infinitely flexible and strictly bounded?
    5. Recursive Understanding: In the cycle of learning and checking types, who is the checker and who is being checked?
    
    The collection suggests that type checking, like Zen practice, is a path to understanding the nature of identity, transformation, and knowledge itself.

# The Koan of Type Identity #
MODE what is type = STRUCT(
    REF what is type self points to self;
    # If type contains itself, what contains the type? #
);

# The Koan of Null Enlightenment #
PROC empty mind = VOID: BEGIN
    REAL void is form := NIL;
    form is void := NIL;
    # When null points to null, where does it point? #
END;

# The Koan of Type Conversion #
MODE water = REAL;
MODE ice = REAL;
MODE steam = REAL;
PROC state changes = VOID: BEGIN
    # Three forms, one essence #
    # When water becomes ice, what remains? #
    water flows to ice;
    ice rises to steam;
    steam returns to source
END;

# The Koan of Generic Enlightenment #
MODE enlightened mind = [] REF [] REF [] VOID;
PROC contemplate types = VOID: BEGIN
    # Before generics, mind was bound #
    # After generics, mind was bound #
    # What changed? #
    enlightened mind holds all;
    all holds nothing;
    nothing holds truth
END;

# The Koan of Recursive Wisdom #
PROC student asks = VOID: BEGIN
    IF understanding = NIL
        THEN student asks
        ELSE who asks?
    FI
END
