preview: "A recursive meditation written in ALGOL 68, where a procedure's self-reflection becomes a Zen koan about consciousness and the nature of thought"
notes:
  composition: "This poem takes the form of a koan, using a recursive procedure as a meditation on consciousness. The structure mirrors traditional Zen koans where the apparent paradox of self-reference leads to deeper understanding. The ALGOL keywords and operations themselves become part of the poetic flow, with 'LOC' and 'SKIP' suggesting temporary states of mind."
  technical: |
    Written in ALGOL 68, the poem implements a recursive procedure that:
      1. Defines a MODE for mind as a REF to a REAL value
      2. Uses a base case where consciousness fades to NIL
      3. Implements recursive self-calls that build up and then unwind
      4. Uses ALGOL 68's CO keyword for comments
      5. Employs 'SKIP' as a meditative pause in the recursion
      
    The recursive pattern reflects both technical accuracy and meditative depth.
  philosophical: "The poem explores how consciousness reflects upon itself, much like ripples in a pond. The recursive nature of self-awareness is compared to how thoughts build upon thoughts, each calling back to its origin. The transformation through recursive contemplation suggests that deep introspection leads to understanding. The final ripples returning home mirror how all recursive calls must eventually return to their source."

MODE MIND = REF REAL;
PROC deep thoughts rise up = 
    (MIND mind) VOID: 
    BEGIN
        CO each thought calls its past CO
        IF mind = NIL 
            THEN SKIP CO dreams fade to dawn CO
        ELSE 
            SKIP; CO thoughts arise CO
            deep thoughts rise up(mind);
            SKIP CO wisdom returns CO
        FI
    END;

CO like rings in still pond CO
MIND soul := LOC REAL;
deep thoughts rise up(soul);
CO ripples return home CO
