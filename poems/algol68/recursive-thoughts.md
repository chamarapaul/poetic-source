preview: "A recursive meditation written in ALGOL-68, where a procedure's self-reflection becomes a Zen koan about consciousness and the nature of thought"
notes:
  composition: "This poem takes the form of a koan, using a recursive procedure as a meditation on consciousness. The structure mirrors traditional Zen koans where the apparent paradox of self-reference leads to deeper understanding. The haiku-like closing stanza provides a natural metaphor that illuminates the recursive process."
  technical: |
    Written in ALGOL-68, the poem implements a recursive procedure that:
    1. Takes a reference to a 'mind' parameter
    2. Uses a base case where consciousness fades to dawn
    3. Implements recursive self-calls that build up and then unwind
    4. Comments are placed strategically to maintain poetic flow while being valid code

    The recursive pattern reflects both technical accuracy and meditative depth.
  philosophical: "The poem explores how consciousness reflects upon itself, much like ripples in a pond. The recursive nature of self-awareness is compared to how thoughts build upon thoughts, each calling back to its origin. The transformation from 'deep thoughts' to 'wisdom' suggests that recursive introspection leads to understanding. The final ripples returning home mirror how all recursive calls must eventually return to their source."

        IF mind = NIL
            THEN dreams fade to dawn
        ELSE 
            thoughts arise here;
            deep thoughts rise up(mind);
            wisdom echoes back

deep thoughts rise up(soul);
# ripples return home #
