preview: "A contemplative ghazal that weaves together garbage collection algorithms with natural cycles of release, using ALGOL 68's precise syntax to explore themes of memory, impermanence, and renewal"
notes:
  composition: "This ghazal follows the traditional form where each couplet (sher) ends with the same word 'free', acting as the radif. Each line maintains a meditative rhythm that mirrors the cyclic nature of garbage collection. The autumn leaves metaphor connects the technical process to natural cycles of release and renewal."
  technical: |
    The poem describes the mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm in ALGOL 68:

    - First couplet: Initial heap scan to identify unreferenced objects
    - Second couplet: Root finding through stack traversal
    - Third couplet: Handling null pointers and memory boundaries
    - Fourth couplet: Tree traversal from root nodes
    - Final couplet: The mark-sweep cycle completion
        
    The use of ALGOL 68's terminology (ref, proc, od) adds authenticity while maintaining readability.
  philosophical: "The poem explores themes of impermanence and natural cycles through the lens of memory management. It draws parallels between computational cleanup and natural processes like falling leaves, suggesting that release and renewal are fundamental patterns that appear across different domains. The repeated 'free' endings emphasize liberation and the beauty in letting go."

scan heap deep where lost refs cease to be;
mark those still held, let others flow free;

proc find roots through stack we gently trace;
like autumn leaves, dead nodes drift free;

ref node next points nil where once was here;
time's edges fade, old bounds break free;

through paths that wind from root to leaves we seek;
collect what falls, let mem run free;

while refs remain do mark sweep done od now;
watch cycles end, let all run free;
