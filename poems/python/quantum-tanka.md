preview: "A meditation on quantum measurement and the emergence of reality through observation, expressed in Python"
notes:
  composition: "The tanka follows the traditional 5-7-5-7-7 syllable structure while exploring quantum themes. The poem moves from pure potential (photons) through measurement (observation) to emergence (truth), mirroring the quantum measurement process. The code structure reinforces this progression through the creation, collapse, and determination of the qubit's state."
  technical: |
    The code implements a simple quantum bit simulation:
      • Qubit class represents a quantum superposition
      • collapse() method simulates quantum measurement, using random() to model quantum uncertainty
      • The final if/return structure represents the binary outcome of measurement
    
    While greatly simplified, this captures the essence of quantum measurement: a superposition of states resolving to a definite value upon observation."
  philosophical: "The poem explores the deep connection between observation and reality in quantum mechanics. Just as a quantum state exists in superposition until measured, truth and understanding emerge only through conscious observation. The progression from uncertainty to definite outcome mirrors both quantum collapse and the process of gaining knowledge. The binary return values (True/False) represent the discrete nature of quantum measurement, while the poetic imagery suggests the mysterious continuous reality that underlies these discrete observations."

    # Waves move, crash and fade
    if measure:           # Until we are observing
