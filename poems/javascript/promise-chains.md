preview: "An asynchronous journey through consciousness using JavaScript Promises"
notes:
  composition: "Embeds traditional haiku forms within the asynchronous flow of JavaScript promises. Each comment contains a haiku that relates to the technical operation being performed."
  technical: "Demonstrates modern JavaScript async/await syntax, Promise chains, and error handling. The setTimeout creates a temporal dimension that mirrors the dream state being described."
  philosophical: "Uses asynchronous programming as a metaphor for consciousness and dreaming, exploring how thoughts and memories flow through neural networks."

async function dreams() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            // Like thoughts drifting
            // Through neural paths at midnight
            resolve('awakening');
        }, 1000)
    })
    .then(consciousness => {
        // Each promise a synapse
        // Firing in sequence
        return consciousness;
    })
    .catch(void_of_sleep => {
        // Dreams slip away like
        // Morning mist on water's edge
