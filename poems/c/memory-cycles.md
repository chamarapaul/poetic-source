preview: "A contemplation of existence through memory allocation and deallocation cycles, where void pointers become metaphors for consciousness emerging from and returning to source"
notes:
  composition: "Uses C's pointer syntax and void type to create a natural flow while maintaining the quatrain structure of RubaÊ¿i. Each line builds toward the cyclical nature of existence, with the comment completing the circle."
  technical: "Leverages C's low-level memory concepts: void pointers represent undefined consciousness, NULL symbolizes emptiness, and the arrow operator creates a flowing rhythm. The function could be part of a memory management system, with proper implementation of the theoretical memory and cycles structs."
  philosophical: "Explores how computational memory cycles mirror the nature of consciousness - emerging from void, cycling through time, facing dissolution, and returning to source. The use of void pointers suggests the unknowable nature of consciousness itself, while memory allocation/deallocation cycles reflect the impermanent nature of existence."
