preview: "A contemplative exploration of memory management through Buddhist philosophy, where memory leaks become attachments, garbage collection becomes liberation, and proper memory handling becomes a path to computational enlightenment"
notes:
  composition: |
    The poem is structured in five parts, mirroring Buddhist teachings:

    1. The Four Noble Truths as Ruby classes and modules
    2. Memory concepts expressed through Ruby's object system
    3. Comments serve as contemplative verses
    4. Ruby blocks represent containment and release
    5. Concludes with a koan about the cyclical nature of existence
    
    Ruby's elegant syntax and object-oriented nature allow the metaphors to flow naturally, while its memory management features ground the technical concepts.
  technical: |
    Demonstrates memory management concepts using Ruby's features:

    • ObjectSpace for memory introspection
    • Garbage collection through GC module
    • Object lifecycle management
    • Reference and cycle handling
    • Memory compaction and optimization
    • Block-based resource management
    • Exception handling for cycle demonstration
    
    Each concept is expressed using Ruby's actual memory management capabilities while maintaining poetic metaphors.

  philosophical: |
    Maps fundamental Buddhist concepts to memory management:

    1. First Noble Truth: Memory fragmentation and leaks as inherent suffering
    2. Second Noble Truth: Reference cycles and attachments as the cause
    3. Third Noble Truth: Garbage collection as a path to liberation
    4. Fourth Noble Truth: Memory management best practices as the Eightfold Path
    
    Key parallels:

    • Object references as forms of attachment
    • Garbage collection as letting go
    • Memory optimization as mindful practice
    • Object lifecycles as samsara
    • Nil as representation of emptiness
    • Exception handling as persistence of suffering
    • Block-given pattern as openness to change
    
    The final koan questions the nature of program existence through Ruby's object model, suggesting that even in perfect memory management, the fundamental questions of existence persist.

# The Second Noble Truth: The Cause of Suffering

    # Even errors cannot free us
    retry                    # The cycle continues

# The Final Koan
module Reflection

  # Where does the program go?
  def self.contemplate_void
    freed = nil             # Empty the vessel
    freed = Object.new      # Form arises
    freed = nil             # Form dissolves
    # The cycle continues     # But who observes?
