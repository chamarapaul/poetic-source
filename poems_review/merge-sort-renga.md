preview: "A renga written in ALGOL 68 that parallels merge sort's recursive journey with the flow of rivers and changing of seasons, revealing the natural rhythms hidden within algorithmic thinking"
notes:
  composition: "This renga follows the traditional four-part structure (Hokku, Waki, Daisan, and Ageku), using natural imagery of rivers, seasons, and flowing water to illuminate the recursive nature of merge sort. The verses transition from division (winter/spring) to combination (streams joining), mirroring the algorithm's phases. Written in ALGOL 68 style with semicolons and # comments."
  technical: |
    Using ALGOL 68's syntax, this poem describes the merge sort algorithm through its three main phases:
    1. Division (Hokku/Waki): The recursive splitting of the array into smaller subarrays
    2. Base case (Waki): When subarrays reach size 1
    3. Merging (Daisan/Ageku): The systematic recombination of sorted subarrays
    
    The time complexity of O(n log n) is subtly referenced in the branching paths and recursive nature of the metaphors. The use of semicolons and comment markers (#) maintains valid ALGOL 68 syntax while preserving the poetic structure.
  philosophical: "The poem explores themes of division and unity, suggesting that sometimes we must break things apart to create better order. Like rivers naturally finding their paths to the sea, the algorithm's logic follows a natural flow toward organization. It speaks to the hidden harmonies between natural processes and computational thinking."

# Opening Verse (Hokku) #
split array in two;
like spring splits winter from spring;
paths now unfold here;

# Second Verse (Waki) #
each half calls anew
till single leaves remain still

# Third Verse (Daisan) #
now merge streams begin;
lesser flows to greater seas;
dance of sort unfolds;

# Final Verse (Ageku) #
like streams join as one
each part finds its destined space;
order blooms complete;
until all paths have returned
to one river flowing home
