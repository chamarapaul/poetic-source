preview: "A Zen meditation on error handling, exploring how exceptions teach us about impermanence, how stack traces guide understanding, and how error recovery mirrors spiritual rebirth"
notes:
  composition: |
    The poem is structured as six interconnected Zen teachings:
    1. Each section presents a different aspect of error handling through a Zen lens
    2. Comments pose philosophical questions in traditional koan style
    3. Code and commentary interweave to create multiple layers of meaning
    4. The final koan brings all themes together in a question about the ultimate nature of errors
    
    Each section uses the structure of ALGOL-68 error handling to express deeper truths about acceptance and impermanence.
  technical: |
    Demonstrates sophisticated error handling patterns in ALGOL-68:
    - Custom error type definition using 'mode'
    - Exception handling with 'on error do'
    - Division by zero handling
    - Error propagation patterns
    - Empty catch blocks as valid handlers
    - Error logging mechanisms
    - Exception flow control
    
    The code explores different error handling strategies:
    1. Structured error types
    2. Mindful exception catching
    3. Empty catch blocks as valid responses
    4. Upstream/downstream error propagation
    5. Error logging patterns
    6. Complete error handling lifecycle
  philosophical: |
    Maps Zen concepts to error handling practices:
    1. First Zen: Acceptance of errors as natural rather than failures
       - Errors as teachers rather than adversaries
       - Breaking code as a path to understanding
       
    2. Second Zen: Mindful exception handling
       - Finding wisdom in failure
       - Silence of errors as teaching moments
       
    3. Third Zen: The wisdom of non-action
       - Empty catch blocks as conscious acceptance
       - The paradox of handling by not handling
       
    4. Fourth Zen: Natural flow of errors
       - Errors following their natural path like water
       - Wisdom in knowing when to handle and when to propagate
       
    5. Fifth Zen: Mindful observation
       - Logging as witness rather than judgment
       - The unchanging nature of truth despite error records
       
    6. Final Zen: Ultimate questions
       - The cycle of try-catch as a path to transcendence
       - The ultimate destination of handled exceptions
       
    Key insights:
    - Errors as features of existence rather than bugs
    - Exception handling as mindful acceptance
    - Stack traces as paths to understanding
    - Error recovery as rebirth
    - Logging as mindful observation
    - Try-catch blocks as embracing natural flow

# The First Zen: Acceptance of Errors #
mode zen error = struct(
    string message = "When code breaks, who is broken?";
    proc embrace = void: begin
        # The perfect code contains imperfect errors #
        on error do
            breathe in peace;
            errors show the way
    end
);

# The Second Zen: Mindful Catching #
proc try mindfully = void: begin
    on division by zero do
        # What is the sound of zero dividing? #
        silence teaches more
        than success ever could;
        return to center
end;

# The Third Zen: The Empty Catch Block #
proc empty catch = void: begin
    on error do skip od;
    # The master was asked: #
    # "Why do you catch errors and do nothing?" #
    # The master replied: #
    # "Why do you do nothing and catch errors?" #
end;

# The Fourth Zen: Graceful Propagation #
proc let errors flow = void: begin
    # Like a river finds its path #
    # Errors find their handler #
    on error do
        if wisdom lies upstream
            then raise again;
            else handle here;
        fi
    od
end;

# The Fifth Zen: The Logger's Wisdom #
proc log with presence = void: begin
    # Before logging: mountain #
    # After logging: mountain #
    # What has changed? #
    write error to log;
    log remains still;
    error passes through
end;

# The Final Zen: The Try-Catch Koan #
proc ultimate handling = void: begin
    on exception do
        # In trying, we fail #
        # In catching, we succeed #
        # In letting go, we transcend #
        release attachment;
        return to source;
        peace finds its own way
    od;
    # When all errors are caught #
    # Where do exceptions go? #
end
