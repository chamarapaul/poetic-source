preview: "A Rubaʿi that speaks to the everlasting strength of love—a force that weaves through time, connecting hearts even when tested by distance, hardship, and the passage of years."
notes:
  composition: "The unbroken thread symbolizes the resilience of love—time, distance, and hardship may strain it, but it never truly frays.


  In the code, love is represented as a tapestry woven from shared moments. The act of stitching symbolizes how each experience—whether joyous or painful—is interconnected, forming an unbreakable whole. Even when time pulls love in different directions, the thread remains intact, binding past and present."
  technical: |
    The code structure reflects the poem’s themes of endurance, continuity, and resilience:

    • The fabric list acts as love’s woven history, collecting each shared experience.
    • The stitch() function ensures each moment links to the past, symbolizing how love builds upon itself rather than existing in isolation.
    • By appending moment → previous moment, love’s story is told as an unbroken thread.
    • The recite() function reverses the order, mimicking how love’s true depth is often understood in hindsight.
    • The final poem is never lost; it only grows stronger over time.

  philosophical: |
    This poem reflects the timeless nature of love:

    • Love as a thread: Each experience binds two souls, reinforcing connection across time.
    • Love tested but never broken: Hardship may strain the fabric, but true love never snaps.
    • Love as memory: Every past moment is woven into the present, proving that nothing is truly lost in love.
    
    Just as the poem stitches lines together, love weaves lives into an enduring whole. It acknowledges that love faces trials, but in the end, the strongest bonds are not those that never fray, but those that endure despite the strain.
