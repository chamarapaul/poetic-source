preview: "An APL meditation on reflection using matrix transformations"
notes:
  composition: "The poem uses APL's dense symbolic notation to explore the concept of reflection. Each operation is chosen not just for its computational meaning but for its visual symmetry. The matrix itself forms a pattern that mirrors the theme."
  technical: "Uses APL's monadic reflection operator (⊖) to perform matrix transformation. The poem creates a 3x3 binary matrix and applies a mirror operation, demonstrating both mathematical and metaphorical reflection."
  philosophical: "Explores the dual nature of computation and consciousness through the metaphor of reflection. The matrix operations serve as a meditation on how we see ourselves in the code we write."
