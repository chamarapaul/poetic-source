preview: "A recursive koan that questions the nature of consciousness through an infinite loop of dreaming, where the dreamer becomes indistinguishable from the dream itself"
notes:
  composition: "Uses the koan form to present a paradox through code. The recursive structure mirrors the cyclical nature of consciousness, while the comment acts as a traditional koan statement. The final question 'who dreams?' serves as the koan's turning point."
  technical: "Employs ALGOL 68's procedure recursion, void return type, and nil checking to create an infinite contemplation. The lack of a base case is intentional, reflecting the endless nature of consciousness."
  philosophical: "Explores the Buddhist concept of no-self through recursive dreaming. Questions whether consciousness is recursive in nature, and if so, where does the recursion end? The nil check represents the boundary between consciousness and void, while the final question challenges the existence of a discrete dreamer."
