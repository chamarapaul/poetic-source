preview: "An Ada exploration of time's flow using parallel processing and strong typing to represent the dance between dreams and consciousness"
notes:
  composition: "The poem uses Ada's package structure to create a metaphorical container for time, with embedded comments providing traditional poetic lines. The separation between specification and body mirrors the division between possibility and realization."
  technical: "Demonstrates Ada's strong typing, package system, task types for concurrency, and privacy mechanisms. The poem uses records to structure data and tasks to represent parallel processes, showing Ada's support for concurrent programming."
  philosophical: "Explores the nature of time and consciousness through the lens of computer memory and parallel processing. The transformation of dreams into memories serves as a metaphor for the experience of awakening and the accumulation of lived experience."
