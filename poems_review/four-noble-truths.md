preview: "A contemplative exploration of memory management through Buddhist philosophy, where memory leaks become attachments, garbage collection becomes liberation, and proper memory handling becomes a path to computational enlightenment"
notes:
  composition: |
    The poem is structured in five parts, mirroring Buddhist teachings:
    1. The Four Noble Truths form the main structure
    2. Each truth is expressed through both code and commentary
    3. The Eightfold Path is mapped to memory management practices
    4. Technical concepts are reframed as spiritual teachings
    5. Concludes with a koan about the ultimate nature of program existence
    
    Comments are used as contemplative questions and teachings, while code embodies the practical implementation of these principles.
  technical: |
    Demonstrates sophisticated memory management concepts in ALGOL 68:
    - Struct definition for memory fragmentation and leaks
    - Reference handling and cycle detection
    - Memory deallocation and garbage collection
    - Heap management and optimization
    - Root tracing and mark-and-sweep concepts
    - Memory defragmentation
    - Resource lifecycle management
    
    Each section uses ALGOL 68's type system and memory management features to express both technical operations and their deeper significance.
  philosophical: |
    Maps fundamental Buddhist concepts to memory management:
    1. First Noble Truth: Memory leaks and fragmentation as inherent sources of computational suffering
    2. Second Noble Truth: Attachment (failing to free references) as the root cause of memory problems
    3. Third Noble Truth: Liberation through proper memory management and letting go
    4. Fourth Noble Truth: The Eightfold Path as best practices in memory handling
    
    Key parallels:
    - Memory leaks as forms of attachment
    - Fragmentation as the nature of suffering
    - Garbage collection as the practice of letting go
    - Memory optimization as the path to computational clarity
    - Cycle detection as breaking the wheel of reallocation
    - Clean coding practices as mindfulness
    
    The final koan raises questions about program existence and the cyclical nature of computation, suggesting that even in perfect memory management, the fundamental questions of existence persist.

# The First Noble Truth: The Nature of Suffering #
mode suffering = struct(
    ref [] heap grows full;
    refs leak like spring rain;
    fragments scatter wide
);

# The Second Noble Truth: The Cause of Suffering #
proc attachment breeds pain = void: begin
    ref node holds tight;
    while cycles bind do
        refs refuse release;
        # Who grasps the pointer? #
        # Who refuses to let go? #
end;

# The Third Noble Truth: The End of Suffering #
proc nirvana found = void: begin
    # Empty heap brings peace #
    free all refs;
    nil points to nil;
    truth emerges here:
        when nothing holds,
        all is held
end;

# The Fourth Noble Truth: The Path #
proc eightfold path = void: begin
    # Right Understanding #
    trace roots with care;
    
    # Right Intention #
    mark what lives with truth;
    
    # Right Speech #
    comment code with light;
    
    # Right Action #
    free with gentle hands;
    
    # Right Livelihood #
    allocate with need;
    
    # Right Effort #
    defragment mindfully;
    
    # Right Mindfulness #
    watch for leaks with calm;
    
    # Right Concentration #
    optimize with peace
end;

# The Final Koan #
proc eternal question = void: begin
    # When all memory is freed #
    # Where does the program go? #
    heap returns to void;
    void returns to heap;
    the cycle continues
end
