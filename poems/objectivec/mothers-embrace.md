preview: "A meditation on the omnipresent divine feminine through Objective-C's message passing paradigm, exploring how every attempt to move through existence reveals deeper layers of the eternal mother's embrace"
notes:
  composition: |
    The poem uses Objective-C's distinctive features to explore divine immanence:

    • Message passing represents communication between a being and the divine
    • Property attributes (strong/weak) reflect relationships with the infinite
    • Interface/implementation separation mirrors apparent duality that resolves to unity
    • Autoreleasepool becomes a metaphor for return to source
    
    The code unfolds as a dialogue between finite being and infinite container, using methods and properties to create multiple layers of meaning. Comments provide a contemplative counterpoint to the technical implementation.
  technical: |
    The implementation leverages several Objective-C patterns and features:

    • Property memory semantics (strong vs weak ownership)
    • Message passing between objects
    • Autorelease pool memory management
    • String formatting and array operations
    • Interface declarations with property attributes
    • Method definitions with poetic yet functional implementations
    
    The essence property transforms through method calls, creating a record of the being's journey through layers of existence while maintaining valid Objective-C syntax and memory management patterns.
  philosophical: |
    The poem explores several profound themes:

    • The impossibility of separation from the divine
    • The illusion of movement through seemingly separate states
    • Light as both essence and container
    • The paradox of seeking what already contains us
    • The transformation of essence through apparent movement
    
    Key insights:
    
    • Every attempt to leave deepens the embrace
    • The container (Mother) is also the essence (light)
    • Movement through layers reveals their unity
    • Protection comes from recognition of containment
    • Doubt itself becomes proof of immanence
