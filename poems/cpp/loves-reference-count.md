preview: "A meditation on love through the lens of C++'s reference counting and memory management, exploring how shared pointers mirror the ways we hold onto and release our attachments"
notes:
  composition: |
    The poem uses C++'s smart pointer system to explore different aspects of love and attachment. Each method represents a different phase or aspect of love:

    • Construction represents new love's awakening
    • Shared pointers represent strong bonds
    • Weak pointers represent memories and past attachments
    • Reference counting mirrors how we hold onto relationships
    • Destructors reflect the natural cycle of letting go
  technical: |
    Leverages several C++ memory management features:

    • std::shared_ptr for shared ownership semantics
    • std::weak_ptr for non-owning references
    • RAII for lifecycle management
    • Templates for generic love types
    • Move semantics for relationship transitions
    • Custom allocators for memory patterns

    The code is both metaphorical and technically valid C++.
  philosophical: |
    Explores several aspects of love through memory management:

    • How do we share our hearts while maintaining boundaries?
    • What happens to past loves - do they truly expire?
    • How does memory of love persist after letting go?
    • When multiple hearts share the same love, who owns it?
    • Is love ever truly destroyed, or just returned to the universe?
