preview: "A contemplative koan exploring type inference as a journey of discovery, questioning whether types are created or merely uncovered by the compiler"
notes:
  composition: "This koan uses a three-part structure common in Zen poetry: positioning (the compiler's questioning), exploration (the paradox of pre-existing types), and resolution (the realization that discovery changes nothing). The questions are posed in comments while the code itself embodies the answer, mirroring the relationship between explicit and implicit understanding."
  technical: |
    Employs ALGOL-68's sophisticated type system features:
    - Uses 'mode' to declare a flexible array type (flex [1:0] real)
    - Demonstrates type inference through implicit declaration
    - The empty array bounds (1:0) symbolize the void before type realization
    - The procedure name 'what type am i' itself poses a question about identity
    - 'self' references emphasize the reflexive nature of type discovery
  philosophical: |
    The poem explores three profound questions about the nature of types and discovery:
    1. The paradox of pre-existence: How can a type exist before it's declared?
    2. The nature of inference: Is the compiler discovering or creating types?
    3. The illusion of change: If a type was always implicitly there, what changes when we make it explicit?
    
    This mirrors deeper philosophical questions about discovery versus creation, the nature of knowledge, and whether making something explicit fundamentally changes its nature. Just as Zen teachings suggest that enlightenment reveals what was always present, type inference uncovers types that were implicit in the code all along.

# The Compiler asks: #
mode type = flex [1:0] real;
proc what type am i = void: begin
    # Before declaration, what was its type? #
    # After inference, who declared it? #
    # When the type is found, where was it hiding? #
    
    type reveals self;
    self was always there;
    nothing has changed
