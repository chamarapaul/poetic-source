preview: "A contemplation of consciousness and existence through void pointers and memory flows, exploring how awareness emerges, transforms, and returns to source"
notes:
  composition: "Follows the RubaÊ¿i's AABA rhyme pattern while using C's pointer syntax to create flowing rhythm. Each line builds on the metaphysical journey of consciousness, from emergence through dissolution to return."
  technical: "Uses C's void pointers to represent the undefined nature of consciousness. The arrow operator (->) creates both visual flow and maintains proper C syntax. Each line represents a valid memory operation while serving the poem's deeper meaning."
  philosophical: "Explores the cycle of consciousness: emerging from void, growing in awareness, facing the dissolution of truth, and ultimately returning to its source. The use of void pointers suggests both the programmatic null and the philosophical void from which existence emerges and returns."
