preview: "A Swift contemplation of impermanence through memory management"
notes:
  composition: "Uses Swift's memory management features to create a metaphor for the cycle of seasons. The spacing and comments are arranged to emphasize the temporal flow of the garden metaphor."
  technical: "Demonstrates Swift's weak references, optionals, defer blocks, and guard statements. The generic type parameter represents the universality of the lifecycle pattern."
  philosophical: "Explores the Buddhist concept of impermanence through the lens of memory management and seasonal changes. The weak reference serves as a metaphor for the transient nature of existence."
