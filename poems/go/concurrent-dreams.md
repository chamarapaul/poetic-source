preview: "A Go meditation on consciousness using goroutines and channels to represent parallel streams of thought"
notes:
  composition: "The poem uses Go's concurrency primitives to create a meditation on parallel streams of consciousness. The structure mirrors the flow of thoughts during meditation, with each goroutine representing a separate thread of awareness."
  technical: "Demonstrates Go's core features: goroutines for concurrent execution, channels for communication, select statements for multiplexing, and time handling. The poem showcases Go's approach to CSP-style concurrency."
  philosophical: "Explores the parallel nature of consciousness and dreams, using Go's concurrency model as a metaphor for how thoughts and memories interweave during meditation. The interplay between channels represents the dance between different levels of awareness."
