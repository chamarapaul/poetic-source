preview: "A Swift contemplation of impermanence through memory management"
notes:
  composition: "Forms a complete 5-7-5-7-7 Tanka through carefully chosen variable and function names, integrating the poetry directly into the Swift code structure. The garden metaphor flows through the naming patterns, from cherry blossoms to autumn dawn."
  technical: "Demonstrates Swift's weak references, optionals, and guard statements with multiple bindings. The generic type parameter represents the universality of the lifecycle pattern."
  philosophical: "Explores the Buddhist concept of impermanence through the lens of memory management and seasonal changes. The weak reference serves as a metaphor for the transient nature of existence."
